### Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

### First the program compares a[0] to a[1], then a[1] to a[2], then a[2] to a[3], and so on until it completes the pass by comparing a[8] to a[9]. Although there are 10 elements, only nine comparisons are performed. Because of the way the successive comparisons are made, a large value may move down the array many positions on a single pass, but a small value may move up only one position.

I/O format:

**_ input:<the_values_of_array_elements> _**

**_ output:<the_values_of_array_elements_orderly> _**

*For example:*
--

>Sample Input: 97 88 76 62 53 47 32 53 12 20

>Output: 12 20 32 47 53 53 62 76 88 97
